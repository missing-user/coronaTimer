# coronaTimer
Experimenting around how to raise more awareness about the severity of the situation by visualizing numbers....
You can see the current version [here](https://missing-user.github.io/coronaTimer/)

It calculates the number of infections and vaccinations per second by taking (yesterday's infections)/24h and then incrementing the counter at the given rate. IMO a simple but powerful way of showing the scale of numbers.

## Reason for archiving 
The he API for retrieving the current COVID-19 infection counts keeps changing and I don't want to keep updating the project anymore.
